Military Dog Training
A military dog’s training extends beyond sit and heel. Only about 50 percent of military dogs make it through the rigorous training. Canines are great for military services because of their sharp minds and abilities, which is why they’re able to serve our country alongside of the men and women who fight for us.

While there isn’t a single breed that is used in the military, certain breeds, including German Shepherds, Belgian Malinois, and Pit Bulls, are best suited for the demanding jobs of a military dog. These K9s are used for:

Combat

Logistics & Communication

Mascots

Detection & Tracking

Scouts

Sentries (Guard Dog)

Police Dogs
