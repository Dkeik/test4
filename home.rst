Dogs play an important role in many people’s lives, regardless of whether they are loving best friends for life, assistance dogs, or military dogs. No matter what our dog’s roles are, we know they contribute so much to make our lives happier, healthier, and safer every day. This month, we recognize K9 Veterans Day to honor the service and sacrifice of American military and working dogs.

 K9 Veterans History

Not only do men and women serve our country, but dogs started being called to duty in the U.S. after the first world war. March 13, 1942 marks the first day that the U.S. Army officially started using K9 Corps (K9 being a homophone for canine) and these Dogs of Defense proved to be fearless, dedicated, and well-trained.

Since then, more than 30,000 dogs have served in the military, with approximately 2,800 military dogs in active duty today according to the American Kennel Club. Military dog heroes span American history, with heroes including Sgt. Stubby, the original war dog, and Chips, who is said to be the most decorated dog in World War II.
